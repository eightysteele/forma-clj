;; ### FORMA Constants
;;
;; Aside from our EC2 information, this is the only data we need to
;; supply for the first phase of operations. Everything else should be
;; able to remain local to individual modules.

(def forma-subsets #{:ndvi :evi :qual :reli})

;; Arbitrary number of pixels slurped at a time off of a MODIS raster
;; band. For 1km data, each MODIS tile is 1200x1200 pixels; dealing
;; with each pixel individually would incur unacceptable IO costs
;; within hadoop. We currently fix the chunk size at 24,000, resulting
;; in 60 chunks per 1km data. Sharper resolution -> more chunks!

(def chunk-size 24000)

;; ## Backend Data Processing Queries
;;
;; The following cascalog queries provide us with a way to process raw
;; input files into bins based on various datafields, and read them
;; back out again into a hadoop cluster for later analysis.
;;
;; ### Data to Bucket
;;
;; The idea of this portion of the project is to process all input
;; data into chunks in of data MODIS sinusoidal projection, tagged
;; with metadata to identify the chunk's position and spatial and
;; temporal resolutions. We sink these tuples into Hadoop
;; SequenceFiles binned into a custom directory structure on S3,
;; designed to facilitate easy access to subsets of the data. The
;; data bins are formatted as:
;;
;;     s3n://<dataset>/<s-res>-<t-res>/<tileid>/<jobtag>/seqfile
;;     ex: s3n://ndvi/1000-32/008006/20110226T234402Z/part-00000
;;
;; `s-res` is the spatial resolution of the data, limited to `1000`,
;; `500`, and `250`. `t-res` is the temporal resolution, keyed to the
;; MODIS system of monthly, 16-day, or 8-day periods (`t-res` = `32`,
;; `16` or `8`). `tileid` is the MODIS horizontal and vertical tile
;; location, formatted as `HHHVVV`.
;;
;; As discussed in [this thread](http://goo.gl/jV4ut) on
;; cascading-user, Hadoop can't append to existing
;; SequenceFiles. Rather than read in every file, append, and write
;; back out, we decided to bucket our processed chunks by
;; `jobid`. This is the date and time, down to seconds, at which the
;; run was completed. The first run we complete will be quite large,
;; containing over 100 time periods. Subsequent runs will be monthly,
;; and will be quite small. On a yearly basis, we plan to read in all
;; tuples from every `jobid` directory, and bin them into a new
;;`jobid`. This is to limit the number of small files in the sytem.
;;
;; Note that the other way to combat the no-append issue would have
;; been to sink tuples into a deeper directory structure, based on
;; date. The downside here is that every sequencefile would be 5MB, at
;; 1km resolution. Hadoop becomes efficient when mappers are allowed
;;to deal with splits of 64MB. By keeping our sequencefiles large, we
;;take advantage of this property.

;; sunk into the corresponding subdirectories, and counts up the
;; number of chunks for each tile and dataset. The test makes it clear
;; that our system doesn't filter duplicates, so we'll have to do this
;; in code, and cull that stuff out every year, on our yearly run.
